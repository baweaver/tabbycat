# Tabbycat

Random tools, wingnuts, and other things I'm using to grok through a ton of tab data from
classtab.org to transfer over to my variant of the site.

I'm doing this to get a more comprehensive dataset including speed, key, tuning, and other
meta information not currently available. I figured since I'm doing this in Ruby anyways
I might as well share a bit.

## Note

I'm likely not going to be making this a sterling bastion of clean code that's well tested.
This is, and likely will remain, a very hackish app for ripping through text files and
JSON.
